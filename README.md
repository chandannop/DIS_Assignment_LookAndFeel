This website is an example of my work, combining my interests in web development and cycling. Through this project, I aim to provide valuable information and resources for bicycle enthusiasts.

This website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The main objective was to create an interactive and responsive site that provides useful information about bicycles. Throughout the development process, I focused on ensuring a seamless user experience and incorporating modern web design principles
